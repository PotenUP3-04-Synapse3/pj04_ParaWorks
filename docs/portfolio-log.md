# ParaWorks Portfolio Log

Last updated: 2026-05-01

This document records ParaWorks work in a portfolio-friendly format. Keep adding
short entries here whenever the product, architecture, UX, verification, or
demo story changes.

## Portfolio Positioning

ParaWorks is a Korean-first, multi-agentic Slack-style collaboration and
knowledge review workspace for business users. The MVP demonstrates how work
messages, SaaS connector events, and review workflows can become searchable,
permission-aware organizational knowledge.

## Current Narrative

The project started as an Adapter-First Demo Harness and evolved into a more
product-shaped MVP:

- A Korean-first business UX with English switching for international-ready use.
- A Slack-like Messenger surface for team conversation and collaboration.
- A review queue that turns selected messages and connector evidence into
  human-confirmed knowledge candidates.
- A Docker-free SQLite smoke mode so the product can be run and demonstrated
  quickly even when Postgres, Redis, and MinIO are unavailable.
- A Slack connector boundary prepared for future real Slack Web API ingestion.

## Work Completed

### Korean-First UX and Messenger MVP

- Added Korean default shell copy and a Korean/English language switch.
- Added `/messages` as a Slack-like messenger screen with channels, timeline,
  and message composer.
- Added backend message APIs for listing channels, listing messages, and
  posting messages.
- Fixed SSE completion behavior so successful sync completion is not shown as
  a stream error.

Portfolio angle:

- Shows product localization for the first target market: Korean business users.
- Demonstrates moving beyond a technical harness into a familiar collaboration
  experience.

### SQLite Smoke Mode

- Added `scripts/start-smoke.ps1` for Docker-free local demos.
- Added a smoke runbook and updated local development and verification docs.
- Smoke mode starts FastAPI and Next.js against a temporary SQLite database.

Portfolio angle:

- Shows practical engineering for demo reliability and onboarding speed.
- Reduces environment friction, which matters for stakeholder demos and hiring
  portfolio walkthroughs.

### Messenger Persistence

- Added SQLAlchemy models for `message_channels` and `messages`.
- Changed message service behavior from process memory to database-backed
  persistence.
- Seeded demo channels and messages on first use against an empty database.

Portfolio angle:

- Shows the transition from UI prototype to stateful MVP infrastructure.
- Establishes a foundation for analytics, search, review, and audit history.

### Messenger to Review Queue

- Added `POST /api/v1/messages/messages/{message_id}/send-to-review`.
- Added UI action to send a message into the review workflow.
- Created review items with message snippets and `paraworks://messages/...`
  source links.

Portfolio angle:

- Connects the Slack-like messenger directly to ParaWorks' knowledge workflow.
- Shows a concrete "conversation to organizational knowledge" product loop.

### Slack Connector Preparation

- Added `backend/app/connectors/slack.py` with a testable `SlackApiClient`
  protocol boundary.
- Added tests for Slack message payload mapping into ParaWorks `SourceEvent`
  records.
- Added Slack integration runbook and environment placeholders:
  `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_CHANNEL_IDS`, `SLACK_WORKSPACE_URL`.

Portfolio angle:

- Shows adapter-first architecture: real SaaS APIs can be connected without
  coupling product logic to vendor SDK details.
- Sets up future real Slack ingestion with pagination, rate limits, OAuth, and
  permission mapping.

## Verification Evidence

Latest known verified state:

- Backend tests: `uv run pytest backend/tests -v` -> 27 passed.
- Frontend build: `npm.cmd run build` -> passed.
- Smoke runtime:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3000/messages`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:3000/review`
- Browser smoke covered message posting, language switching, sending a message
  to review, and confirming the created review item on `/review`.

## Portfolio Demo Script

1. Start the SQLite smoke environment with `.\scripts\start-smoke.ps1`.
2. Open `/dashboard` to show the product overview.
3. Open `/messages` to show Korean-first Slack-like collaboration.
4. Post or select a message and send it to the review queue.
5. Open `/review` to show the message as a knowledge review candidate.
6. Explain that connector data and messenger data share the same review/search
   architecture.
7. Point to the Slack connector boundary as the next real-world integration
   step.

## Next Portfolio-Worthy Milestones

- Implement `RealSlackApiClient` with Slack Web API cursor pagination and
  rate-limit handling.
- Add Slack OAuth install flow and token storage decisions.
- Map Slack channel/private-message permissions into ParaWorks review/search
  access rules.
- Add message-to-knowledge actions such as "create decision record" and
  "create todo".
- Add focused frontend regression tests for Messenger and review actions.

## Product North Star Update: Multi-Agent Knowledge Automation

Recorded on 2026-05-01.

ParaWorks' final target is an AI-agentic company memory platform. The agent
system will use multi-agent orchestration with LangChain 1.x and LangGraph 1.x
to automate:

- Email summarization, review, timeline creation, and history creation.
- Slack channel/message summarization, review, timeline creation, and history
  creation.
- RAG over generated timelines/history and internal company documents.
- Permission-aware answers for Korean business users.

The first recommended vertical slice is:

Slack channel/messages -> agentic summary and review -> timeline/history
candidates -> Review Queue.

Portfolio angle:

- Shows the transition from MVP collaboration surface to AI orchestration
  platform.
- Makes token cost optimization a product and architecture requirement from the
  start, not a late performance cleanup.
- Supports a three-developer split across agent runtime, data/RAG, and product
  UX.

## Collaboration Guide Update: Equal Agent Ownership

Recorded on 2026-05-01.

Added `AGENTS.md` as the repo-level collaboration guide for human developers
and coding assistants. The guide changes the team split from technical layers
to equal agent ownership:

- Slack Agent.
- Mail and Document Agent.
- RAG and Orchestrator Agent.

It also codifies evidence-first AI output, Review Queue as the trust boundary,
permission propagation, token-cost accounting, fake-LLM testing, and assistant
behavior rules for Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, and similar tools.

Portfolio angle:

- Shows that ParaWorks is being developed as a serious multi-agent system with
  team-scale engineering discipline.
- Makes AI safety, cost optimization, permissions, and human review explicit
  development compliance requirements.

## Integration Pipeline Update: Assistant-Safe Merging

Recorded on 2026-05-01.

Updated `AGENTS.md` with a development pipeline for three independent agent
tracks and coding assistants:

- shared contract branch first;
- feature branch per agent;
- integration branch for frequent green merges;
- contract tests as the merge gate;
- human decision points for schema, permission, cost, trust-boundary, and
  duplicate-resolution policy changes.

Portfolio angle:

- Demonstrates that ParaWorks is designed for AI-assisted team development, not
  only AI-powered product features.
- Shows awareness that Codex can help resolve conflicts, but stable contracts,
  registry-based integration, and verification gates must exist before the
  merge.

## UX Direction Update: Slack-Like Workspace

Recorded on 2026-05-01.

Started a frontend UX pass to make ParaWorks feel like a Korean-first
Slack-like business workspace rather than a plain demo harness.

Planned scope:

- darker workspace navigation rail;
- top command/search entry for future AI/RAG usage;
- richer Messages channel surface;
- Tools/Apps-style Integrations page;
- cleaner Korean-first operational copy.

Implemented scope:

- redesigned the shared app shell into a Slack-like workspace rail;
- added a top command/search bar and agent readiness affordance;
- upgraded Messages with denser channel navigation, timeline styling, review
  actions, and an anchored composer;
- upgraded Integrations into a Tools/Apps surface with connector readiness and
  sync activity panel.

Verification evidence:

- `npm.cmd run build` from `frontend` passed without warnings.
- HTTP smoke returned 200 for `/integrations`, `/messages`, and `/dashboard`
  on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

Portfolio angle:

- Shows product sense and UX architecture, not only backend AI engineering.
- Prepares the interface for Slack Agent, Review Inbox, and RAG Orchestrator
  experiences without a later full layout rewrite.
